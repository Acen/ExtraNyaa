## ‚ö†Ô∏è GOOGLE REVIEW CONSIDERATIONS

### High-Risk Areas for Chrome Web Store Review:

#### 1. **OAuth Token Storage** üî¥ **HIGH RISK**
- **Risk**: We store MyAnimeList OAuth access tokens locally
- **Mitigation**: Tokens are stored using Chrome's secure storage API, not transmitted to external servers

#### 2. **Cross-Site Data Access** üî¥ **HIGH RISK**
- **Risk**: Extension reads content from both Nyaa.si and MyAnimeList

- **Google Concern**: Cross-site data access may trigger additional scrutiny

#### 3. **API Data Collection** üü° **MEDIUM RISK**
- **Risk**: We fetch comprehensive anime lists from MyAnimeList API
- **Mitigation**: Data is used only for extension functionality, not shared with third parties
- **Google Concern**: Large-scale data collection may require additional justification

#### 4. **Real-Time Monitoring** üü° **MEDIUM RISK**
- **Risk**: Extension monitors page changes on MyAnimeList in real-time
